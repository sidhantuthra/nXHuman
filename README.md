The Center for Innovation in Pharmacy Simulation at UNC Chapel Hill is developing a game-based virtual patient for pharmacy, nursing, and other students to learn to engage with different kinds of patients. Underlying the virtual patient are a series of AI modules that drive its emotional, physiological, cognitive, gestural, linguistic, and other actions and behaviors. Every virtual patient also requires a ‘case’—all the details that a user needs to understand the patient’s pharmacy or medical needs. CIPS is developing a case authoring tool aimed at expert pharmacists, nurses, and others for them to enter all those behavior and health-related details.
